    "It's interesting how much weight had an impact on correlation. Height is still significant, but clearly not as much as weight. In this case it appears that time is almost insignificant when analyzing 40 yard performance, but when we look at charts there is a downward trend. It would be interesting to compare just the average for the year to time and see how correlation compares. From external knowledge it's clear that performance science and athletic ability have improved over time. When we have other factors such as weight this is drowned out. "
