    "The goal of this project is to create a regression model that could be used to predict 40 yard dash times for college and at-home athletes. The requirements and features should be kept minimal to reduce the possibility of mis-measurement or needing special equipment. \n",

    "Approach:\n",
    "1. Explore the data.\n",
    "2. Attempt to use a few regression models on the full dataset.\n",
    "3. Optimize the models.\n",
